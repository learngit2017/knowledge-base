= Redux

a JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management.

== What is Redux

Redux is

* A single store containing "global" state
* Dispatching plain object actions to the store when something happens in the app
* Pure reducer function looking at those actions and returning immutably updated state

Not required, but Redux code also normally includes:

* Action creators that generate those action objects
* Middleware to enable side effects
* Thunk functions that contain sync or async logic with side effects

== Core Redux API

* `createStore` to create a Redux store
* `combineReducers` to combine multiple slice reducers into a single larger reducer
* `applyMiddleware` to combine multiple middleware into a store enhancer
* `compose` to combine multiple store enhancers into a single store enhancer

== Core Redux Toolkit API

* `configureStore`
** sets up a well-configured Redux store with a single function call
** including combining reducers, adding the thunk middleware, and setting up the Redux DevTools integration.
* `createSlice`
** lets you write reducers that use the Immer library to enable writing immutable updates using "mutating" JS syntax like state.value = 123, with no spreads needed.
** It also automatically generates action creator functions for each reducer, and generates action type strings internally based on your reducer's names.

== Other Redux Toolkit API

* `createAsyncThunk` abstracts the standard "dispatch actions before/after an async request" pattern
* `createEntityAdapter` prebuilt reducers and selectors for CRUD operations on normalized state
* `createSelector` a re-export of the standard Reselect API for memoized selectors
* `createListenerMiddleware` a side effects middleware for running logic in response to dispatched actions

== react-redux API

* `Provider` a React component that youâ€™ll render at the top of the React app. Any components rendered as children of Provider can be granted access to the Redux store.
* `connect` a function used as a bridge between React components and data from the Redux store.
